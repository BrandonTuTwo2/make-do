# [Make Do: Cocktail Searcher](https://make-do.netlify.app/) 
A fun little web application that I made to check what cocktails I can make with the ingredients I have and want to use


## How to use
-   You search up cocktails by entering in the ingredients it can contain (be wary of spelling!)
-   Note that it will only show cocktails that contains all of the ingredients you specify
-   It will always show a max of 10 cocktails

## Tech Used
- Angular 
- SCSS
- Typescript
- HTLM/CSS
- Spartan.ng
- Express.js
